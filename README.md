# Go Programming Course

## Requirements
- Solid experience with another programming language: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, or similar.

## Description
Go is an open source programming language created by Google. As one of the fastest-growing languages in terms of popularity, it's a great time to pick up the basics of Go!

This course is designed to get you up and running as fast as possible with Go. We'll quickly cover the basics, then dive into some of the more advanced features of the language. Don't be tricked by other courses that only teach you for-loops and if-statements! This is the only course on Udemy that will teach you how to use the full power of Go's concurrency model and interface type systems.

Go is designed to be easy to pick up, but tough to master. Through multiple projects, quizzes, and assignments, you'll quickly start to master the language's quirks and oddities. Go is like any other language â€” you have to write code to learn it! This course will give you ample opportunities to strike out on your own and start working on your own programs.

### In this course you will:
- Understand the basic syntax and control structures of the language
- Apply Go's concurrency model to build massively parallel systems
- Grasp the purpose of types, especially if you're coming from a dynamically typed language like JavaScript or Ruby
- Organize code through the use of packages
- Use the Go runtime to build and compile projects
- Get insight into critical design decisions in the language
- Gain a sense of when to use basic language features
